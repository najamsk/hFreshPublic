Your personal life is constantly on the back-burner.

This is a tough situation because you

* Love your job!

* A high-achieving, experienced educator.
* Going through a stressful career or life transition.
* Committed to growth, but have reached the limits of what you can do by yourself.
* Feeling stuck in certain areas, “busy”, reactive, stressed, or lacking joy and inspiration.
* Struggling to focus on the bigger picture, your purpose, the school's vision.
* Giving your best self to work, but lacking presence at home.
* Missing someone with whom you can process your own thinking - it can be lonely being a leader.

> Doing the PQ program has allowed me to improve my relationships with colleagues: I have become less judgmental towards myself and others by breaking down some of the invisible walls that I had build up around me after each negative and traumatic experience I had in my life. 
<br>
<br>
I can say that some colleagues have now become great friends and this has made my job much more joyful; this could not have happened without rewiring the brain at root level as this program does. 
<br>
<br>
As a teacher of children and young adults, I can truly see the benefit of applying this coaching program in schools as part of the guidance programme and/or part of the learning support and wellbeing programme. 
<br>
<br>
Karin is very knowledgeable and knows this program inside out: she quickly responds to all your queries or doubts. I could not have got all the benefits from the program without the extra tips and explanations that Karin provided me with. I truly recommend Karin and this program to everyone: even the most balanced people can benefit from doing all the exercises regularly under the guidance of such a great coach!
