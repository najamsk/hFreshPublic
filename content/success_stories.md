I needed a new direction in life and Karin helped me find it. Working with Karin as a coach individually and in a group setting with the PQ program, helped me see areas of my life that I was sabotaging. Because Karin in thoughtful, whip-smart, and caring she is able to guide her clients with clarity and a sense of purpose. I highly recommend Karin as a mental fitness coach. She will show you how to build your mental fitness in no time, but the rest is in you.

What can I say about Karin? Karin is good, no Karin is great, no Karin is mighty talented. Karin can see where you as a client want to be and can help to lead you there. Like a teacher Karin understands that she can not simply give you the answers you so want and crave or you will not learn. That being said, she is very good at pointing you in the right direction and guiding you to where you want to be. She will ask where you want your starting point to be and what you want to accomplish as a final goal then she will get to work and with both patience and great skill she will guide you through. I have had other therapists in the past and I am happy to admit that I have made more progress in what I want to accomplish in terms of my mental health within the short time that I have had Karin as a coach than my previous therapist. If someone is ready to work towards becoming a mentally healthy person then I would highly recommend Karin as a guide to see them through.



I started meeting with Karin for career coaching sessions because I felt I needed a change in my career, but I wasn’t sure what. What a marvelous experience! She has a real knack for helping me sort out the mental clutter that I experience when I’m in my own head. She never told me what to do or what to think, but she gave me the environment and the resources to figure out what I was thinking, to reflect critically on my assumptions, and to open myself up to different ways of thinking. I wanted to end each session with a couple of manageable concrete steps I could take, so she helped me come up with those too. Now I'm doing what I want to be doing, and I am excited for what's coming next in my career.
After our individual sessions reached a natural stopping point, I joined a Positive Intelligence pod which she led and facilitated. It was an absolutely lovely group of people, and Karin laid the groundwork for a really rewarding and supportive community!

I have never met any professional so capable of being present for their client, so able to notice and ask about spaces in their sentences, changes in their demeanour, an eyebrow or glow in their eye, and all of these through the screen!

After years of traditional therapies, I was recommended to hire Karin as a life coach seeing that everything else seemed to be too slow for what I was going through.

Karin has helped me in ways I can't express in paper, and continues to do so.

If you feel lost or stuck in any area of your life, here is someone that will 100% find the way to help you out.
