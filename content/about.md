<h1>Grow Yourself to Grow Your Vision</h1>

I help leaders feel less overwhelmed and more in control so that they can grow their vision for their lives and for their institutions


<h5 class="secondary h5 is-secondary">In a nutshell, I am:</h5>

* **Curious** - About the world, people, myself, how humans think, feel and behave.
* **Passionate** - About sustainability, justice and equity, diversity, coaching, education, health.
* **Caring** - I’m very empathetic, supporting others has always been my calling.
* **Growth-oriented** - I love learning, and I constantly look for ways to improve and challenge myself
* **Risk-taker** - I follow my passion despite the challenges

* We challenge beliefs, “truths”, and come up with different perspectives so that you come up with your own insights, action steps and solutions.
* Coaching saves you time and energy in the long run - it cuts down on the ruminations, the indecisiveness, you improve your clarity of mind, focus, and confidence in decision-making.
* My coaching helps you GROW personally and professionally.

<section class="about checked-list mb-6">

A high-achieving, experienced educator.

Going through a stressful career or life transition.

Committed to growth, but have reached the limits of what you can do by yourself.

Feeling stuck in certain areas, “busy”, reactive, stressed, or lacking joy and inspiration.

Struggling to focus on the bigger picture, your purpose, the school's vision.

Giving your best self to work, but lacking presence at home.

Missing someone with whom you can process your own thinking - it can be lonely being a leader.
