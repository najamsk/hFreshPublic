{{% title3 "The Offical bio" %}} 
With a background of 20 years in international education (MSc Education and MSc Counselling), she has deepened her skills in being of service to others, by becoming an Advanced Certified Professional Coach (CPC), Certified Group Coach, Associate Certified Coach (ACC) with the International Coaching Federation (ICF), and a Certified Positive Intelligence (PQ) Mental Fitness Coach. This professional development has led her down a path of great personal transformation and growth, which she is keen to share with others. She embodies everything she is passionate about, prioritizing health, being aware of the connection between body-mind-soul, and believing in yourself.

Karin is idealistic and passionate about themes such as sustainability, equality, diversity, equity and inclusion. Above all her values are connection, trust, believing in oneself, growth, and making a difference. Her mission is to empower service- and growth-oriented leaders to be the best version of themselves, so that they can inspire others to follow their lead and make their part of the world a better place.

As a Third Culture Kid and Adult, Karin has personally experienced many different kinds of major transitions. From moving countries every few years as a child, changing university studies several times as a young adult, to living and working internationally, becoming a parent, repatriation and two career changes... transitions are a part of her life.

Karin's vast experience growing up, living and working in international communities, makes her adaptable, flexible and open-minded to work with people from all cultures. As a matter of fact, diverse communities are where she thrives, is most effective, and feels most at home. 

In her free time she reads, loves to travel and explore, takes walks, likes experimenting with vegan recipes, toots a tune in a choir, and is a mom of two teenage girls. She currently lives in The Hague, The Netherlands.

* Coaching is time and space completely dedicated to processing your thoughts and feelings with a non-judgemental, caring, thinking parter, me!
* We challenge beliefs, “truths”, and come up with different perspectives so that you come up with your own insights, action steps and solutions.
* Coaching saves you time and energy in the long run - it cuts down on the ruminations, the indecisiveness, you improve your clarity of mind, focus, and confidence in decision-making.
* My coaching helps you GROW personally and professionally. 


> Karin has a real knack for helping me sort out the mental clutter that I experience when I’m in my own head. She never told me what to do or what to think, but she gave me the environment and the resources to figure out what I was thinking, to reflect critically on my assumptions.

>Learning about the saboteurs was what really helped me. I didn’t believe it at first, but they are very real! If something is feeling difficult, there is a saboteur involved. Knowing how to calm yourself down, and realizing when you’ve been sabotaged, that self-awareness is invaluable. I apply it to all aspects in my life.

Do you avoid difficult conversations or tackling tough problems? Do you procrastinate? 


Do you feel the need to be in control of everything? Which is exhausting and stressful? And others people pull away from you?
Do you have a Hyper-Achiever drive? Focused on successes… and failures. Always thinking “I’ll be happy when I achieve X”, but the happiness is fleeting?
Do you tend to rationalise everything, feel less comfortable with emotions? And find it challenging to maintain healthy relationships?
Are you constantly on the lookout forofr dangers and what can go wrong? Making you feel anxious all the time?

Do you have a Pleaser side to yourself? Always putting other people’s needs ahead of your own? But you don’t have much to give?
Are you constantly feeling Restless, jumping from one thing to the next? When it gets hard you move on?
Are you a Perfectionist? Spending so much time on detail that you lose sight of the bigger picture and what’s really important? 
Do you feel like life has it in for you? You’re a victim of circumstance, life is bad-bad-bad all the time and you have no choices?
Do you have a strong Judge? Telling you, you’re not good enough, or others aren’t good enough or circumstances are just “bad” all the time?

> I have been coached by Karin over the last 6 months, and the meetings have become amazing space to be in. Her coaching presence and the safe atmosphere that she creates are a perfect combo to reflect, mirror and grow. Her teaching background and natural curiosity feel like a genuine combination to make the right questions.
Not feeling judged or disregarded at any time plus all the above helps to sit in an environment that allows vulnerability to flow, and with that answers to your own questions just appear. <br><br>
The combination of those factors and her Positive Intelligence techniques have really helped me to get out of “the feeling stuck” sensation and realize other ways of acting, thinking and overcoming personal and professional issues. I could not recommend her enough to anyone going through a transition in their lives.
