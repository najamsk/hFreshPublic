      <description>He moved over to the window Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly.

      <description>Grow Yourself to Grow Your Vision I help leaders feel less overwhelmed and more in control so that they can grow their vision for their lives and for their institutions
In a nutshell, I am:  Curious - About the world, people, myself, how humans think, feel and behave. Passionate - About sustainability, justice and equity, diversity, coaching, education, health. Caring - I’m very empathetic, supporting others has always been my calling.</description>

      <description>You are a leader who is:  Growth-oriented, idealistic, and mission-driven. In some personal and/or professional transition. Committed to personal and professional growth, but have reached the limits of what you can do by yourself. Feeling stuck in certain areas, “busy”, reactive, stressed, or lacking direction, joy and inspiration. Struggling to focus on the bigger picture, your purpose. Giving your best self to work, but lacking presence at home. Ready to work on mental patterns and behaviours that no longer serve you and find a deep level of contentment and calm within, no matter what is going on around you.</description>

      <description>I experienced burnout due to a combination of personal and professional circumstances during a major international move and career change. I lost confidence in my skills and abilities, and my mind and body became ruled by fear, panic and negative self talk.
My main doubt about coaching with Karin was my ability to make the time and monetary commitment for it, but I discovered that my job was able to support me on both fronts.</description>
